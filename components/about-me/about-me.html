          <p style="text-align: center;">I’m a firm believer that exercise is an essential component of a healthy lifestyle, benefiting both body and mind. I get a lot of satisfaction from helping clients transform their lives as they overcome old injuries, reverse health issues, lose weight, gain strength, mobility, self-esteem, and confidence or enhance athletic performance.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">I was first inspired by a mentor to take up boxing as a form of therapy and rehabilitation from a life of substance abuse and self-destruction following a troubled childhood. I needed a constructive way to channel my emotions and develop discipline. Having ADHD, I needed something physically challenging and mentally rewarding. After a year of consistent boxing training, I got into weightlifting. The two activities worked together amazingly as a foundation to rebuild my life. I've endured many injuries over the years including 2 severely crushed discs and painful tendonitis from working in construction. These injuries have led me to learn alternative methods of exercising and self rehabilitation helping me to conquer potentially debilitating issues. I’m a huge advocate for all types of exercise as a solid base for addiction recovery, weight loss, managing mental health, and overall lifestyle improvement.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">Professional Background:<br>13 years personal training both groups and individuals, specializing in strength training, hypertrophy (for growth), High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), boxing for fitness with guidance on technique, fat loss and rehabilitation from injuries. Have spent several years training with some of NZ’s strongest powerlifters both at Miada Gym (now rebranded) in Auckland and at a private gym in Dunedin specifically set up for strongman training. I have worked with competitive boxers and MMA fighters focusing on technique, explosive strength and fitness, various other types of sports enthusiasts including triathletes, rugby, basketball, netball, and volleyball players. Have recently trained local Waka Ama teams and currently training several top Waka racers who represent NZ overseas.</p>
