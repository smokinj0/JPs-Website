            <h3>My transformation</h3>
            <p>This is where I started my health and fitness journey, at a very unhealthy 78kg's. I now sit at 125kg's and paired with a healthy diet, I follow a combination of strength and high intensity cardio training routines. In my late 40's and I'm fitter and stronger than I've ever been. </p>

          <h3>Harper</h3>
          <p>Harper started with a 10 week bootcamp to kickstart his fitness journey and has made incredible progress since then. By the end of the initial 10 weeks, he had lost considerable body fat and gained noticeable muscle mass, strength and increased his fitness. This introduction to the gym was enough to motivate Harper to make it a part of his lifestyle routine and 18 months later with monthly check-ins and adjustments to his programs hes looking super fit and shredded as. </p>

          <h3>Amanda</h3>
          <p>Amanda has made some of the fastest strength gains I've ever witnessed. She had no previous gym experience before training with me and decided to take up powerlifting in her late 30's. In less than 1 year she went from struggling to squat an empty bar to taking out the majority of the females side of the strong-lifts challenge board at our gym. 140kg deadlift and 120kg squat (amongst a few others!) are outstanding lifts.</p>

          <h3>Pete</h3>
          <p>Pete came in after being convinced by a workmate that gyming might help with his back and leg pain, and it certainly did! He also wanted to gain size and strength. In 12 months Pete has managed to go from 76kg to 95kg and more than doubled the weight of every lift while developing his boxing skills and greatly improving his fitness and overall wellbeing.  </p>

          <h3>Georgia</h3>
          <p>Georgia was another newbie to the gym and had been intimidated by the whole idea of it. I helped her overcome her anxiety and build her confidence in a gym environment. Together we achieved some fantastic results and she dropped 18kg in 12 weeks. </p>

          <h3>Hunter</h3>
          <p>Young Hunter had tried the gym casually with some school friends in the past but never really achieved anything and was a bit lost with correct form and workout structure. In 6 months she put on 7kgs of lean muscle and developed excellent form and coordination, and can now structure her own workouts but likes to check in monthly to make sure shes keeping on track.   </p>

          <h3>Steve</h3>
          <p>Steve was an experienced lifter but had taken a couple of years off to focus on other things. We met and he asked me if I would help him with preparing for the end of year South Island Powerlifting competition. I was honoured, so together we developed new routines and foucused on regaining his strength. I was extremely proud when he took out 1st place for his age group in 2 lifts, with deadlift at 347kg and a squat of 335kg he is 1 of the strongest powerlifters in the country. </p>
